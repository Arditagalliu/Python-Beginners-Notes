# Python-Beginners-Notes
This repository is composed of python scripts as examples of python basic 
abilities, syntax, functions, data types etc. 
I created this repository based on freecodecamps.org
(Beginners python full course) by giraffe academy.
I hope these notes help you as much as they helped me
1)HelloWorld.py : here are the very basics of input output and simple data types 

2)Lists.py: as the name suggests here are some basic lists applications tuples 2-d lists 3-d lists and some functions

3)Functions.py:functions implemented and executed, if statement examples, variables scope, in-and-or-not operators

4)Loops.py: examples of for-loop, while-loop, try-except and ranges(types),
continue-break commands

5)Dictionaries.py: a simple dictionary implementation

6)Files.py: reading, writing, appending, (creating text files) in index.html and text.txt

7)Modules.py: this is a file with ready functions and variables tio be imported in other python scripts(HelloWorld.py)

8)Objects.py: here are created two classes where the second inherits the first and objects are created
